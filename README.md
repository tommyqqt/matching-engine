# CLOB-Matching-Engine
### A reference implementation in Java of a central limit order book - matching engine that is low latency and low gc 

Assumptions in this implementation of this CLOB-Matching Engine:
- Simple interactive command line interface to manually place orders and see execution reports
- Each limit order book handles one specific instrument (ccypair)
- Tick value = $0.01
- Prices in double are converted to long with precision = 2
- For each instrument, its prices move within a minimum and maximum pre-configured values
- No auto adjust of min and max price
- Price levels are kept in an array indexed by price
- The order book maintains an index to the best bid/offer level
- Each price level has an array-list of resting orders at this price
- The resting orders array list has an initial capacity = 20. Assuming there are typically at most 20 resting
  orders per price level
- New orders are processed in order of arrival
- Uncrossed orders are appended to the resting orders list of the respective price levels
- If an order is partially crossed, the order will be appended to the respective level with the unfilled quantity (FAS)

1. Build
    - cd matching-engine
    - mvn clean install package

2. Run the app against external properties file
    - cd matching-engine
    - java -DconfigFile=./external_config.properties -jar ./target/matching-engine-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
